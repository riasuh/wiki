# Soporte
_El rol de Soporte es un símbolo de agradecimiento. Gracias por los miles de mensajes y cientos de horas dedicadas a ayudar a la gente a resolver sus mods, y para construir un conocimiento de la solución de problemas base a través de macros y el wiki. Normalmente no damos este rol, pero cuando lo hacemos es porque alguien ha ido más allá y más allá para el servidor._
