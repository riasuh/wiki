# Supports
_O cargo de Support é um símbolo de agradecimento. Obrigado por milhares de mensagens e centenas de horas gastas ajudando as pessoas a resolver seus mods, e pela construção de um conhecimento da base de solução de problemas através de macros e wiki. Nós normalmente não damos esse cargo, mas quando o fazemos é porque alguém ultrapassou o servidor para além dele._
